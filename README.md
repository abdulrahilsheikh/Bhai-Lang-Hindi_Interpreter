# Bhai-Lang-Hindi_Interpreter
This is a hindi version of Bhai-Lang developed in python.
This idea is inspired from [Bhai-Lang](https://bhailang.js.org/). <br /><br />The idea of hindi as a programming language is emerged form the movie Intersteller.
Altough there is no language that can programme in hindi so i made this tool.
Altough its just a toy programming language and using hindi for programming is a fun as well aproud moment for hindi speaking people.
<br /><br />This is just a tool to convert hindi syntax in to python syntax.
the final programme runs on python.
So mak sure that python is intalled on your system befor trying this out.
<br /><br />
This approach can be used to use any speaking language like Marathi, telgu, tamil, pujabi, bengali etc to be used for programming.
The only drawback is that all the words used as syntaxes cant be used in any of the variable becaus the tool replaces every word macthing the synatx in the programme to replace it with english equivalent syntax.
Feel free to modify this tool  and do tag me to show what did you do.
